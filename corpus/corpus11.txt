This is such a tasty and different lunch from the standard pasta and pizza on offer in Rome. We tried the garlic chicken cone (which was tender, buttery and flavoursome). We also couldnâ€™t leave without trying the Suppli which again was totally delicious. If we had more time we would definitely visit again and possibly plan some drinks around our food- as there is a lively bar within the same joint. Excellent value for money, tasty, satisfying and really unique!
