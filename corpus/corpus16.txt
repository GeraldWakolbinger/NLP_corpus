We arrived around 6:30 pm. Our 2nd stop on our 4hr Trastevere by Sunset food tour. We had such a nice, fun visit. Our servers were very friendly, and super helpful. I am embarrassed to say that I do not remember which version of the Trapizzini I had. What I can tell you is that it was delicious. I would love to return to try more of the offerings.
