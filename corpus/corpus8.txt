We had an AirBnB around this place. Not only was it on my radar before getting to Rome it was recommended by one of my e-bike guides when I told him we were crashing in Testaccio.

Love the home town feel of Testaccio.

Line ups down the street for this place. Chicken is spectacular, and the meatball too. Heard tongue and cuddle fish are divine as well.

This area is the best part of Rome for dining.

Ciao!
