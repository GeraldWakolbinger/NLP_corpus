I stayed directly above this phenomenal tiny eatery and began to call it home. My kitchen away from home. The generously stuffed mini “sandwiches” are served on a little wire rack and there are so many fresh options. The chicken cacciatore was my favorite and was clearly slowly roasted. The supplì were fresh and melt in your mouth. While the menu has lots of options there are special features daily. Beer and wine are also available.

It stays busy but the line moves fast. Seating appears limited, but you can bring your food next door where there are many tables. Definitely a must-visit in Testaccio!
